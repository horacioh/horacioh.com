A couple of days back, **I got a new macbook pro 16"** ðŸŽ‰. Few months back I saw some people sharing their _dotfiles_ and I was curious.

> dotfiles are basically a set of configurations we as developers use in order to configure our machines the way we like.

one thing that I was not aware was that you can actually **create a executable file with a bunch of commands to not only change configurations, but also Install apps!**. I went to the internets and find a couple examples like [Roberttables's (David Poindexter)](https://github.com/mtheoryx/dotfiles) and [Kent's (Kent C. Dodds)](https://github.com/kentcdodds/dotfiles). It's a common practice, you can find in github a lot of [examples](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles)

#### Here's what I end up using ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/horacioh/dotfiles](https://github.com/horacioh/dotfiles)

For now is a little disorganize, but this files helped me setup my new maching is **a lot less time than I thought**. Just count the time you waste going to an app's website, download the _.dmg_, go through the wizard, delete the _.dmg_ and another extra stuff you might need to do; compared to **just tun one simple command**. For example, if you want to install [Notion](), you only need to run:

```bash
brew cask install notion
```

**That's it, nothing else...** isn't it that cool???

Go and check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/horacioh/dotfiles) and let me know any questions you may have. I promise I will organize it similar to how [Roberttables](https://twitter.com/drpoindexter) did it (he is the best!!)
