# Review

## Effectiveness can be learned

No one born being effective. Being effective takes practice and discipline. We just need to be consistent and start doing the things that matter the most.

## Know thy time

Time is the most valuable asset we all have. everything takes time and we cannot exchange time with anything (we cannot buy time). That's why is really important to know how we are using it and make sure we are not wasting it too much.

here are some questions you can ask yourself about time management:

### What happens if I stop doing X task?

If the answer is `Nothing`, then STOP doing it. 100% this task is making you waste your time.

### Can I delegate X task to someone else that can either do it equal or better than myself?

If the answer is `Yes`, then delegate!, that way you can use your time to other important and more meaningful tasks

## What can I contribute?
