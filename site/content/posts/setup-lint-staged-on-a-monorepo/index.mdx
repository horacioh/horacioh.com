For my new project (more news soon) I need it to setup a monorepo (M O N O R E P O) and I wanted to check some tooling in order to validate and check multiple things before pushing to Github.

What I found out was that in order to setup [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) correctly, **it needs to be installed only in teh root of the project**. If you have both tools installed on each package, it will not run when you commit. Thanks to yarn workspaces, I can still run my pre commit scripts on each package from the root, al automated using husky and lint-stages. Here's how:

- go to your monorepo root
- `yarn add lint-staged husky --ignore-workspace-root-check` (you need the `--ignore-workspace-root-check` flag so the packages will be installed in the root of the project)
- Setup lint-staged and husky the way you prefer (either in the `package.json` file or with separate rc files: `.huskyrc` and `.lintstagedrc`). You can see more about these tools on their own repos
- setup your pre-commit script on every package. the script name needs to be the same. In this example I'm using `lint` as my pre commit script.
- setup a `lint` script in the root's `package.json` with `yarn workspaces run lint`.

### and that's it!.

lint-staged will run the root's `lint` script, and Yarn workspaces will run each package `lint` script using the `yarn workspaces run lint` command.

In the [repo](https://github.com/horacioh/monorepo-changesets-lint-staged) you'll find also other tools setup (like prettier, npm-run-all, eslint, tsdx and more). Please feel free to ask me any questions about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hhg2288) and hope this will help you!

Big kudos to [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) because most of the pre commit scripts you'll see in the repo comes from his [testing javascript](https://testingjavascript.com/) course!.
